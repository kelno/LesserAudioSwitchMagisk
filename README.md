# Lesser AudioSwitch Magisk module
Lesser Audio Switch, Magisk Module, for rooted Android 11+

## Requirement
- Root (for installing)  
- Magisk v20.4+

## Tested
Works on my fairphone 3 with LineageOS 21 (Android 14), with Magisk 28003.

## Known issues
- [Forcing the bluetooth microphone doesn't work (on some phones?) (link to issue)](https://github.com/kelno/LesserAudioSwitchMagisk/issues/1)
  
Maybe we can mod the app further to fix it, help is welcome! I have no experience in Android development.
  
## How to use
Make sure all versions of regular Lesser AudioSwitch are uninstalled before installing this module. (not 100% sure it's needed but author of APK specifies this)  
Download from [Release page](https://github.com/kelno/LesserAudioSwitchMagisk) and install it with Magisk Modules Manager.
